# Building_R_functions_t-test_chi-sq-test
Built a generic functions that can be used to perform t-test and chi-sq test on binary classification problems that can be used across any dataset.
For demonstration purpose i've used framingham dataset. 
For generic use, binary classification variable dataset's numerical, categorical and target variable should be mentioned and the respective dataset should be read.
